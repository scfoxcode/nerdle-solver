# Nerdle Solver

## What is Nerdle ?
Nerdle is a number game (not made by me https://nerdlegame.com) that was taking up far too much time in my mornings.

## What is This ?

A misguided urge to give Haskell another look lead to this. A program to calculate the valid equations in a nerdle game, based on information obtained from your first guess.

I would advise against using this Haskell code for the purpose of learning Haskell. I am a complete Haskell newbie, and my goal was simply to get something working.
